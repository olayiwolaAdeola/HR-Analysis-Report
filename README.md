### Age Distribution
Understanding the age distribution of an employee is necessary for workforce planning, diversity management and successful planning. it also helps Hr identify trends related to employee demographics . For this analysis , we can see that we have 48% middle age staff, 32.3% experience staff and 19.7% young staff which means the organization has a balanced workforce, with a strong presence of middle-aged.

Other visualisations done are:
- Salary distribution by job title

The average salaries for Specialist, Analyst, Manager, Engineer, and Coordinator appear to be close to each other, with little variation. This indicate a standardized pay structure across these job titles. The dotted line representing the maximum salary fluctuates across roles. The engineering role shows a noticeable dip, meaning some engineer may be earning less than the highest earners in other roles. Manager and specialist have higher maximum salary points compared to engineer and Coordinators. If certain roles have lower maximum salaries than expected, it may indicate limited salary growth opportunities or a cap on their salaries. The Management might need to review whether technical roles are fairly compensated compared to senior roles like Manager

Looking at the Gender Distribution, it shows that most departments have a mix of male, female, and non-binary employees, though the proportions may vary. Some departments, such as HR and Sales, appear to have a higher concentration of one gender which is female over the others. This might be because HR and Sales roles is associated with skills like communication, relationship-building, and emotional intelligence.

- Spread of Salary
- Average Tenure over the years.

This chart visualizes average employee tenure (blue bars) and attrition rate (blue line) over time.
The average tenure remains relatively stable, with some small variations over the years. There is a noticeable peak around 2018–2019, suggesting employees stayed longer during this period. The attrition rate (line graph) declines after 2015, indicating fewer employees were leaving. However, around 2020, attrition spikes, possibly due to external factors like industry shifts or economic changes or covid. The rate stabilizes but remains higher than previous years, suggesting continued turnover challenges. When attrition is high, average tenure decreases—meaning more employees leave before staying long. When attrition drops, employees stay longer, increasing average tenure.

Below is my Dashbord overview , using powerbi.

## Conclusion

The HR Analytics Dashboard provides key insights into the workforce structure, salary distribution, performance trends, and overall employee demographics. A few critical observations include:
- Workforce Demographics: The organization has a well-balanced workforce, with 48% middle-aged, 32% experienced, and 19.7% young employees. However, the lower percentage of young employees may indicate a potential talent pipeline challenge in the future.
- Salary Distribution: The salary analysis shows disparities among job roles, with engineers earning the lowest salaries, while managers and specialists earn the highest. This could affect employee motivation and retention in lower-paid roles.
- Performance Insights: The average performance score is 2.95, and the top performance percentage is 14%, indicating that only a small fraction of employees are top performers.
- Gender Diversity: The gender distribution appears relatively balanced across different departments, but further analysis may be needed to ensure equal opportunities in leadership roles.
- Employee Tenure & Attrition: The trends in tenure and attrition suggest fluctuations in employee retention over time, which could be influenced by internal policies, career growth opportunities, or market competition.

## Recommendations
- Talent Development & Recruitment Strategy: Increase the hiring of young professionals to ensure a sustainable workforce and leadership pipeline. Implement mentorship programs where experienced employees guide younger talent.
- Salary Structure Review: Assess and adjust the salaries of engineers and other lower-paid roles to ensure competitive compensation. Conduct salary benchmarking against industry standards to address any pay disparities.
- Performance Improvement Plans: Implement training and development programs to enhance employee skills and productivity. Recognize and reward high performers to boost motivation and encourage better performance.
- Retention & Employee Engagement: Identify key factors influencing attrition and implement retention strategies such as career growth opportunities and employee wellness programs.
Conduct regular employee satisfaction surveys to address workplace concerns.
- Diversity & Inclusion Initiatives: Promote equal opportunities in leadership and managerial roles to ensure diversity across all job levels. Create mentorship and networking programs to support underrepresented groups in the company.

By implementing these recommendations, the company can improve employee satisfaction, optimize compensation structures, and enhance workforce productivity, leading to overall business success.
